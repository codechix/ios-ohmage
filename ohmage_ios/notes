---------------------

The 3.0 server docs are here: https://github.com/ohmage/server/wiki/3.x-Documentation

We are still working on the API documentation, but we have a good version of the docs for the "people" APIs:
https://github.com/ohmage/server/wiki/3.x%20People%20APIs

For the ohmlet features, we should talk through again. Basically the standard use case for 3.0 is that a user can only belong to one ohmlet at a time.
